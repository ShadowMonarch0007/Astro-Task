                                                        These
                                                        globules are potential
                                                        sites for the formation of new stars, as gravity acts upon them,
                                                        causing them to collapse
                                                        and eventually give rise to protostars. These stellar nurseries
                                                        provide valuable insights

                                                        sites for the formation of new stars, as gravity acts upon them,

                                                        sites for the formation of new stars, as gravity acts upon them,
